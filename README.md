# Intro
Build a 3D printer is fun, but it can be also painful while find and organize these of tech staff, mods, configs \
Hence I create this hub and try to consolidate them as a signal entry for my printer build guide (yours maybe) \
Even this is mainly focus on Voron and klipper but most of them can be used by other DIY/Commerical printer as well 

Feel free to raise a ticket at issues tab or submit a commitment if you have anything can be shared \
I can be reached at [![Discord Icon](/images/discord-24.png "Discord") Voron channel](https://discord.gg/voron)  via @jerryji

**Big thanks for all these awsome creators, you guys make all happen!**
**And happy printing**

Salute for these legacy corexy printers, they bring the corexy printer for more popular \
Even now, one of my dream is remix they to have these fancy klipper features under a reasonable budget
