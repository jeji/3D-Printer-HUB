# 3D Printer HUB
Build a 3D printer is fun, but it can be also painful while search in tons of tech staff, mods, configs

Hence I collect all useful information here and make them organized (kind of) 

Feel free to raise a ticket at issues tab or submit a commitment if you have anything can be shared

I can be reached at Voron Discord chanel via @jerryji

Big thanks for all these awsome creators, you make all happen!

Happy printing
